# Test Putter Progress Summary

## Project Overview
Test Putter is a web application for learning Test-Driven Development (TDD) through interactive coding challenges. Each "hole" represents a programming problem that users solve by following the TDD approach - writing tests first, then implementing code to make them pass.

## Current Status
We've successfully transformed the application from a golf-themed putting game to a programming challenge platform with TDD functionality.

### Completed Features:
1. **CodeMirror Integration**: Added a code editor component for writing solutions
2. **TestRunner Component**: Created a test execution system that runs tests in sequence to simulate TDD workflow
3. **Challenge Structure**: Designed YAML data structure for programming challenges with:
   - Function signatures
   - Test cases with expected outputs
   - Solution approaches
   - Learning objectives
4. **UI Transformation**: Redesigned the interface to reflect programming focus instead of golf theme
5. **Test Validation**: Implemented browser-based testing with real-time feedback

### Technologies Used:
- Next.js 15.3.2
- React 19
- CodeMirror for code editing
- TailwindCSS for styling
- js-yaml for YAML parsing

## Project Structure

### Key Components:
- `/components/HoleDetail.tsx`: Displays individual coding challenges with code editor and tests
- `/components/TestRunner.tsx`: Executes tests against user code and displays results
- `/components/HolesList.tsx`: Lists all available challenges
- `/public/data/holes/*.yaml`: Challenge definitions in YAML format
- `/app/holes/[id]/page.tsx`: Dynamic route for individual challenges
- `/app/page.tsx`: Home page with challenge list and info

### YAML Structure for Challenges:
```yaml
id: "1"
name: "Factorial"
description: "Implement a function that calculates the factorial..."
difficulty: "beginner"
par: 5

function_name: "factorial"
parameters:
  - name: "n"
    type: "number"
return_type: "number"

starting_code: |
  function factorial(n) {
    // Your implementation here
  }

tests:
  - name: "handles zero input"
    code: "factorial(0)"
    expected: 1
    hint: "The factorial of 0 is defined as 1"
  # More tests...

solution_approaches:
  - name: "Iterative"
    description: "Use a loop to multiply all numbers from 1 to n"

learning_objectives:
  - "Understanding basic looping or recursion"
  # More objectives...
```

## Next Steps
Potential improvements for future sessions:

1. **User Progress Tracking**: Add localStorage or database storage to save user progress
2. **Solution Submission**: Add functionality to submit and verify complete solutions
3. **Authentication**: Add user accounts to track progress across sessions
4. **More Challenges**: Create additional YAML files for more programming challenges
5. **Tutorial Mode**: Add a guided walkthrough for users new to TDD
6. **Syntax Highlighting**: Enhance code editor with better syntax highlighting and error checking
7. **Solution Comparison**: Show optimal solutions after completion for learning
8. **Performance Metrics**: Track timing and attempts for each challenge
